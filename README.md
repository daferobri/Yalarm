The above video is a demo of the website that shows all the functions.

This program must be ran using Flask. This allows for functionality between the Python files and the HTML and Javascript files.

PROFILES
This website allows for various profiles to be made, each of which having different alarms. By clicking either Register or Log In on the start page, users can create a new account or use an existing one. Furthermore, users can change their password to an existing account.

NEW ALARM
Users can click New Alarm once they reach the index in order to make new alarms for their profile. These alarms will give a notification and ring at the time set until the Stop Alarm button is pressed. They will also repeat the next day and onwards unless deleted.

DELETE ALARM
Users can delete alarms when they no longer have a use for them by clicking the Delete Alarm tab and choosing from a dropdown which alarm to delete.
